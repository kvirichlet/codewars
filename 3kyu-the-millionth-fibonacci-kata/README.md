# [3kyu] The Millionth Fibonacci Kata

[Original kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53d40c1e2f13e331fc000c26)

## Details

In this kata you will have to calculate `fib(n)` where:

```
fib(0) === 0
fib(1) === 1
fib(n + 2) === fib(n + 1) + fib(n)
```

Write an algorithm that can handle `n` up to `2000000`.

Your algorithm must output the exact integer answer, to full precision. Also, it must correctly handle negative numbers as input.
