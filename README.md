# Codewars solutions

Codewars kata solutions in Javascript (v18.x).

Do not read solutions if you plan to solve the kata on your own. It will just ruin all the fun.

## Development notes

Codewars has a limit on the execution of the entire set of test cases (12 seconds). All written solutions comply with the specified limit and have been verified and submitted.

## Repository structure

The repository consists of folders with completed katas. The folder names begin with the "{number}kyu", where the number indicates the difficulty of the task from 8 (beginner) to 1 (expert).
