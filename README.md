# Codewars solutions

Solutions of Codewars katas in Javascript (v10.x).
I do not pretend to be the number one katas solver using best practices to solve them, however, tried to make efficient, easy-to-read and maintainable code. Do not read my solutions if you plan to try to solve the katas yourself. That would just ruin all the fun.
Feel free to [add me](https://www.codewars.com/users/Dirichlet).

## Development notes

Some features of the latest (v16.x) node version are not supported since an older (v10.x) version is used in the Codewars sandbox . Thus, a number of solutions are solved in a different way that could have been done more simply in the current version.
Codewars has a limit on the execution of the entire set of test cases (12 seconds). All written solutions comply with the specified limit and have been verified and submitted.

## Repository structure

The repository contains folders with a description of the kata, its solution and examples (arguments and the expected result). Most kata contain only a set of simple fixed test cases based on boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning including main positive and necessary negative cases. If the task requires additional test cases, they will be contained in an additional file.
Also, some katas will contain random cases. They are not necessary and will only be added as a solution to an interesting academic problem of generating random data for more complex problems.
